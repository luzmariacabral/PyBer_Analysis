# PyBer in Review: January to April 2019

One of the reasons PyBer is attractive as an employer is becuase it provides a much needed service and ride sharing is a green way to help clean the environment. Looking at a large area of service we see the type of cities serviced differ between urban, suburban, and rural. Each of these types has different needs and this analysis will review how PyBer meets them and possibly how to make it better. 


## Overview of PyBer

In reviewing the data and plotting it in different types of graphs, visuals that will be presented along this reports. It is abundantly evident that PyBer does great in the Urban setting, its use is less in surburban cities and minimal in rural towns. We took a look at some variables that would effect these outcomes like the frequesncy the app was used in the different city types, if fares effected the use of the app and if driver availability was also a factor in the success of Pyber in these different settings. 

In the graph above we see that between the months of January to April 2019 PyBer did very well within Urban settings. The income for the company in Urban cities was between $1500 and $2500/wk and had the highest number of rides. Subrurban came in second with an income between $650-$1200/wk and rural town drove in between $0 and $500 a week for PyBer. It's hard to say how these numbers can increase in the Urban setting, maybe a larger comparison with other cities to see how this sample does in comparison. Also a review of other transpotation services and what innovative way PyBer can help with rush hour commmutes. 

PyBer seems to be struggling the most in suburban and rural towns. Suburban towns are more geared towards families and in most cases these will have a minimum of 1-2 cars. In this setting it would be good to review where people are working, are heads of family commuting to larger cities to work? How can PyBer meet some of these transporation needs? Also being more aware of community events since most of the time these will require transportation assistance. Where in urban settings bars and clubs can provide a larger clientelle, in the suburbs community event have a large pull.

Finally PyBer is struggling in rural settings. This makes sense, wi-fi/broadband may not be readily available to everyone. Also the distances that need to be travelled may be longer and not cost efficient. If it's $50 to travel to the doctor in the city and another $50 to travel back this is will push a customer to look for method of transportation. In rural settings PyBer may look to local government in how to improve broadband and emphasize in looking for drivers that can push for wider availability. 

In looking at the scattered plot graph above we see how each city type ranges and that there isn't much overlapping between these urban settings. In looking for an outlier there really wasn't any except for a small exception in the Urban number of rides, this means that a few rides were out of the regular zones. Reviewing fares customers in urban cites paid on average $24.52 per ride, where it increased in the suburbs to $30.97 and $34.62 in rural areas.

Another issue to factor in is availability of drivers. In out analysis the average number of dirvers available in urban cities were about 36 in the sample size, 13 is suburban areas and 4 in rural towns. Reviewing our driver policies and incentives may be needed to hire and retain more drivers.

## Next Steps

Ultimately PyBer like any company would like to see an increase in revenue and services that it provides. This analysis proves there is much room for improvement for PyBer in the availability of service in suburban and rural cities. If there was an increase in drivers in these 2 sectors there could be an increase in rides.
PyBer should increase recruitment, review the types on incentives that can be offered to drivers and well as increase support to them. For example, if there is a festival going on, let them know about it but also speak with organizers to have a hub for drop off and pick up. 

Since fares are so high in rural areas offering different promotions to increase awareness of the app and service and also more affordable fares. Further investigation into how well promoted is the application and what are common spaces visited by the locals may be good investment. Compensating influencers in these townships would increase visibility. Finally, as mentioned above reviewing where most people work and offering communal rides, for a lower fee the customer would share the ride with other commuters. These are possible avenues for PyBer to continue growing.
